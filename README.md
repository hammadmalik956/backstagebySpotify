Backstage, or backstage.io, is a developer portal platform. It provides the ability to abstract away a lot of the infrastructure, CI/CD, and operational knowledge needed to run an application or product. Also, it can establish the foundation of your developer experience to provide a central hub of information for your company’s services.
What Problems Does Backstage Solve?

Consider the developer experience at companies that don’t use a tool like Backstage.
For that, I’ll ask that you sit back and picture what may be required at many companies to ship new products and build applications from scratch.

Let’s say our hypothetical team also wants to integrate with an existing internal service. First, to simply find the service or API,
they need to talk to their architect or leadership, search Slack or GitHub, wade through out-of-date documentation, or dig through Excel spreadsheets to find who owns the service and what the integration process involves.

To get more detailed information on how the service works, they might repeat the previous process. Often, they make their biggest breakthroughs when they know someone who knows someone on the application team they need to connect with in order to unblock their progress. And if any of that information changes, they may not find out until it’s too late. Changes in the SLOs/SLAs, support, and upgrades usually get sent out via email–hopefully someone is watching out for relevant changes.
Oftentimes the data or knowledge necessary to build anything in large organizations is siloed and segregated in different systems. Whether they use GitHub for source code, LogDNA for logging, Datadog for monitoring, or PagerDuty for alerting, the development teams often have to piece the information together and then create their own adhoc documentation or wiki to keep that information close at hand.

All of this adds toil, knowledge silos, and complexity.
Nothing is ever in one place and easy to use.Most large companies have at least some of these problems.
And many have a lot of these. Perhaps some of these points feel familiar to you. So what do we do now that we understand the problem?
Our industry has become much more aware of the customer experience and how our software affects it.

But we’ve paid less attention to the developer experience.
Backstage solves this by providing a platform to design your developer portal in a way that fits your software engineering ecosystem.
And it leverages Spotify’s software development know-how and the years they’ve spent solving this problem internally.
